# **Tormented Wojack**

## Wojack illustration of our worst days in life.

I came up with this wojack edit while watching other similar doomer illustrations. While I like a lot of the ones I find in the internet, I felt like there was something missing in most of them, they were missing darkness. This is my contribution to the community to make depressed wojacks more representative of the times they are supposed to represent, dark times.

It can also represent the psychotic behaviour someone might feel like adopting when everything starts lacking meaning and we don't know what to do anymore. Powerless and more enraged than ever, seeking something, might be hapiness, vengeance, calmness...

Remember, we are gonna make it.
